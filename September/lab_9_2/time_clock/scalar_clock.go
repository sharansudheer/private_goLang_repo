/*
By following these steps and considering the additional considerations,
you can effectively implement a scalar clock with 3 processes and 4 events
(message sending and receiving) using GoLang to analyze 
causality and concurrency in your distributed system. 
*/

/*
You can customize the message structure to include additional information if needed.
Consider using a more advanced data structure for the scalar clock
if you need to handle more complex scenarios.
For larger-scale systems, you may want to explore distributed
clock synchronization algorithms like Vector Clocks or Lamport Clocks.
