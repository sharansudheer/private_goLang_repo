2. Write a program in Go to get two numbers from the user. Check if the first number is a divisor of the second number.

5. Write a Go program using the concept of go routines. An array of integers is created by the user. Write three functions which are defined as go routine.
Function 1 – reverses the array
Function 2 – count the number of odd/even elements in the array
Function 3 - Check the number of zeros in the array

7. Create a struct rect in Go with the following fields { int x, int y , float area, float perimeter. Write functions and methods in go to calculate the area and perimeter of the rect.
Use variable names with your rollno/names as suffix / prefix
